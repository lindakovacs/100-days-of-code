### Day 0: February 30, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Joined the challange.


### Day 1: January 03, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp last month. Today I started the #100DaysOfCode, where I played few hours with the Tribute Page from #FreeCodeCamp challenge.

**Thoughts**: One year ago I've started coding in daily basis, and I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. It's a great feeling when I finally build a web app from the challenge after testing and fixing bugs.

### Day 2: January 04, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the GitHub creating repositories and forked my codepen tribute page and export it in github and gist.github. Also, tried to figure it out the Github pages to link my github account to github pages. Created my GitHub Pages. #100DaysOfCode challange @FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: I'm so excited to learn new development tools that I can use to write code and deploy new web apps. Overall, I feel like that I am slowly getting better at it. Many things are still new for me, but I managed to figure out some of it's functionality.
